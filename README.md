## What to do

1. Fork the repo
2. Add an upstream

   ```
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/leungc70/scheduler.git
   git fetch upstream
   ```
   
3. For team collaboration, remember to do all your work in a local branch then do a pull request so that we can merge it on "scheduler/master"
